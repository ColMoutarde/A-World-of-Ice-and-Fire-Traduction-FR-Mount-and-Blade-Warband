qstr_{s12}Ships_were_an_i|{s12}Ships were an important part of society, not only as a means of transportation, but also for the prestige that it conferred on her owner and skipper.Their ships permitted the people to embark on their voyages of trading, of raiding, and of exploration.Cogs are large sailing ships with their bows and sterns built at a higher level than the rest of the ship in order to form a castle like structure,which is used to defend the ship from enemies using archers. The Cog was the first type of boat that used the new idea of a rudder mounted on the sternfor steering purpose. However as this is still a rather new idea, many cogs are still equipped with steering oars, which were also known as side rudders.The early cogs, weren't very large and had open hulls which didnt offer much sailing capability.^^Nowadays the cogs are used for sailing through rough waters and their hull is made from clinker construction, which provides them withadded strength and robustness. Their hulls also grew in size as they evolved into large cargo carriers.^^Cog are ships with flat bottoms. They have a ridge or keel that runs along the lower side of the ship. On both sides of the keel, thereis lapstrake planking, firmly fixed by iron nails. The stern and stern posts are both straight in shape and attached to the keel plateby means of hooks. The plank of the keel is thicker than the lapstrake and planking at the sites and moreover, the stern mounted centralrudder is an integral part of the cog construction. It is this design, that makes cogs more stable than any other type of ship.^^Generally built from oak wood, cogs have only a single long mast, which carries a massive square sail. The size of the sail depends on the size of the hull. This means that as the size of cog hull became bigger, the size of sails also increased. The only drawback of this constructionwas that it prevented sailing directly into the wind. However it facilitated the yacht so far, that it could be handled by a small crew,reducing the overall operational cost.{***}

Bastards of noble origin raised in the Vale are given the surname Stone. The borders of the Vale are held to be the Bite to the north, the Bay of Crabs to the south, the Mountains of the Moon and then the riverlands to the west, and the narrow sea to the east. The Vale consists of various regions: the Vale of Arryn itself; the Mountains of the Moon; the snakewood; the Fingers; and the islands of the Three Sisters, the Paps, and Pebble. The Vale is located on the eastern shore of Westeros, a land of fertile soil, rivers, and lakes, protected by its largely impassable Mountains of the Moon.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_territ|You are in the territory of Dragonstone.^^Dragonstone is a castle located on the island of the same name at the entrance to Blackwater Bay. Located below the Dragonmont and shaped from stone to look like dragons, Dragonstone was the original seat of House Targaryen in Westeros, and had been colonized and fortified as the westernmost outpost of the Valyrian Freehold. The castle has a dark reputation. The ancient fortress was built using advanced Valyrian techniques of masonry that were lost in the Doom, causing it to look unique among all the castles in Westeros.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_kingd|You are in the kingdom of Norvos.^^Norvos, called Great Norvos by its people,[1] is one of the nine Free Cities. The domains of Norvos stretch as far as the western bank of the Darkwash to the east and the Upper Rhoyne to the west. The Noyne is ruled by Norvoshi river galleys as far south as the ruins of Ny Sar, where she joins the Rhoyne. The city also claims dominion over the Axe upon the Shivering Sea, though the Ibbenese are known to dispute this claim, often bloodily.Norvos' climate contains sweltering summers and bitter cold winters, with harsh, cold winds, and a pale, wan sun.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_territo|You are in the territory of the North.^^The north has been ruled by the Starks for thousands of years from the castle known as Winterfell. Bastards of noble origin raised in the north are given the surname Snow.  The north is vast in size. While some say it is nearly as large as the the other territories combined, in actuality it is roughly a third of the landmass controlled by the Iron Throne. The region is sparsely populated, with vast wilderness, forests, pine-covered hills and snow-capped mountains, speckled with tiny villages and holdfasts. Its climate is cold and harsh in winter and occasionally it will snow in summer.The north has two major land barriers, the Wall to the north and the Neck to the south. The north is bound on each side by major seas, the Shivering Sea to the east and the Sunset Sea to the west.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_territor|You are in the territory of the Riverlands.^^The riverlands are a central region of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, consisting of the rich, fertile, and populous areas around the three forks of the Trident and the northern Blackwater Rush. The riverlands encompass a region of plains, forests, hills, and endless rivers, and borders on every single kingdom except Dorne.At the time of Aegon's Conquest the riverlands and the Iron Islands were ruled by House Hoare, the Kings of the Isles and the Rivers, although native river kings ruled centuries earlier.  Because of their central position in Westeros and lack of natural boundaries, the riverlands have been a frequent battleground. The people of the riverlands are known as rivermen or occasionally riverlanders,[8] and they are a mixture of hardy warriors, peaceful fisherfolk and devout smallfolk. Their lords have a reputation for being notoriously quarrelsome, and are refered to as river lords.Noble bastards born in the riverlands are given the surname Rivers.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_territory|You are in the territory of the Reach.^^The Reach is the most fertile part of Westeros and has numerous and well-populated villages and towns. Noble bastards born in the Reach are given the surname Flowers. Here is considered the home of chivalry in Westeros. It is the place where knighthood is looked upon with the greatest reverence and esteemed the most. It is also the place where the rules to tournaments are the most stringent and managed. This region also includes several islands, including the Shield Islands near the mouth of the Mander and the Arbor south of the Whispering Sound and the Redwyne Straits. {***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdo|You are in the kingdom of Braavos.^^Braavos sprawls across a hundred islands in a vast lagoon. The Volantenes are fond of boasting that the hundred isles of Braavos can be dropped and drowned in their own harbour at the mouth of the Rhoyne.  Within the kingdom of Braavos also lies the city names Braavos, also known as Braavos of the Hundred Isles and the Secret City Additionally, Braavos is sometimes referred to as the bastard daughter of Valyria.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_territory_|You are in the territory of the Iron Islands.^^The Iron Islands is an archipelago in Ironman's Bay, located in the Sunset Sea off the western coast of Westeros. Noble bastards from the Iron Islands receive the surname Pyke. The Iron Islands are home to a fierce seafaring people who call themselves the ironborn. While some say the archipelago is named after the abundant iron ore on the islands, the ironmen claim it is instead named after their own unyielding nature. It is often said that every captain is a king aboard his own ship, so the islands are also called the land of ten thousand kings.[{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_territory_o|You are in the territory of Dorne.^^Dorne is the hottest region of Westeros. The region is rocky, mountainous, arid and dry, and features the only desert on the continent. Dorne is bordered by the Sea of Dorne to the north, the islands known as the Stepstones to the east, and the Summer Sea to the south. Stretched between them is the mountain range known as the Red Mountains, which separates Dorne from the stormlands to the north and the Reach to the northwest and west.There are two major passes, the Boneway and the Prince's Pass, which go through the Red Mountains to the Dornish Marches of the stormlands.The southern coast is some four hundred leagues long. It is ridden with cliffs, whirlpools, and hidden shoals, with few safe landings.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_territory_of|You are in the territory of the Nights Watch.^^The Nights Watch guard the wall which protects the realms of men. Here it is mostly cold, wet and bleak consisting of little wildlife and population.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_territory_of_|You are in the territory of the Free Folk.^^Alt Clut is a Briton kingdom located northwest of the Anglo-Saxon realms and south of Alban, along the banks of the river Clyde. It emerged after the fall of Roman Empire with the town of Alt Clut as its capital. With its high, fortified rock (Alt), Alt Clut resisted one attack by the Dal Riata and three by the Picts. An alliance of Picts and Northumbrians finally captured Alt Clut after a siege of several years. However, 18 years ago the men of Alt Clut were able to burn the Pictish city of Dunblane.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_territory_of_t|You are in the territory of the Dothraki.^^The Kingdom of Cornubia occupies the southeastern peninsula of Great Britain, bordered on the north and west by the Celtic Sea and on the south by the English Channel. Cornubia was the home of the Celtic tribe known as the Cornovii, whose economy was based on tin since ancient times. Separated from the Britons of Wales after the Battle of Deorham, they have been all but eclipsed by the expanding Saxon kingdom of West Seaxe. These people span the Channel, and they take refuge on the continent.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom|You are in the kingdom of Pentos.^^The small Celtic kingdom of Glywyssing was founded out of a western chunk of the former Silures by Eugenius, the son of High King Magnus Maximus. This was the most Romanised part of Wales, although they were descended from the Iron Age tribe of the Silures. Glywyssing is said to be named after Glywys, a legendary early monarch. Lately, it has been locked in a bitter feud with Brycheiniog.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_territory_of_th|You are in the territory of the Targaryens.^^Uladh is the kingdom located in the north of the island, the homeland of the Gaelic Ulaid, after whom the kingdom is named, and the Cruithne tribes, an early population linked with the Picts of northern Britannia. The Ui Neill dynasty, descendants of Niall of the Nine Hostages, are absorbing the kingdom, dominating it from their base in Tir Eoghain.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom_|You are in the kingdom of Myr.^^Situated in the southeast of Ireland, the tribes of Laigin were united by Ugaine Mor, its first historical king, who built the hill-fort of Dun Ailinne. When the Roman legions left Britain, the people from Laigin settled North Wales. For a long time, the rule of Laigin was disputed by two dynasties, the Ui Dunlainge and the Ui Cheinnselaig, but finally the first one got the control of the crown. Nineteen years ago, during a general Norse attack on the British Isles, a Norse army was defeated at Sciath Nechtain by Lorcan mac Cellaig of Laigin and Olchobar mac Cinaeda of Mumain. Nevertheless, the Vikings have created several colonies on the coast.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom_o|You are in the kingdom of Tyrosh.^^Situated in the south of Ireland, the kingdom of Mumain is ruled by the Eoganachta dynasty. Nineteen years ago, after multiple defeats by invading Norsemen, Olchobar joined forces with his eastern neighbour, Lorcan mac Cellaig, King of Laigin, to stop them at Sciath Nechtain. Among the dead was one Tomrair, jarl of the king of Laithlind.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom_of|You are in the kingdom of Lorath.^^Connachta is an Irish kingdom situated in the northwest of the island. Conn of the Hundred Battles, a legendary king of Ireland, was progenitor of the later ruling Connachta tribes and the namesake for the kingdom of Connacht. Some centuries later, the ancient line of Connacht kings was displaced by midland rulers, whose centre was at Tara. Two members of this Tara dynasty, Brion and Fiachra, founded clans, the Ui Briuin and the Ui Fiachrach, to which all the current rulers of Connaught belong. Conchobar mac Taidg Mor is from the Ui Briuin branch. Currently, the Norse seem intent on settling an island in the middle of the river Shannon.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_territory_of_the|You are in the territory of the Westerlands.^^Aileach is an Irish kingdom in far northwestern Ireland. The kings of Ailech belong to the northern Ui Neill, said to be descended from Niall of the Nine Hostages. The kingdom takes its name from the hill fort Grianan of Ailech. This kingdom broke away from the Kingdom of Uladh, inhabited and under the sovereignty of the Cenel nEogain tribe. Now in a feud with Ui Neill to the south, the rulers engage in a 'tradition' of alternating the crown of the High King of Ireland between them.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom_of_|You are in the kingdom of Lys.^^Mide means 'middle,' due this kingdom's position in the middle of Ireland. It was created by Tuathal Teachtmhar who, having subdued the rulers of the four kingdoms of Ireland, created his own realm from lands around the Hill of Tara that he annexed from them. Niall of the Nine Hostages later established himself as king of Tara. For six centuries afterward, almost without interruption, his descendants were considered the high kings of Ireland. His son Loegaire succeeded him and welcomed St. Patrick to his court. Niall's sons and grandsons have continued to annex parts of northern Laigin to carve out the sub-kingdoms of Mide and Brega for their descendants. Currently, the Ui Neill of Meath have an arrangement to alternate the crown of High King with their cousins from Ailech, even as they continue to feud.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom_Q|You are in the kingdom Qohor.^^In the North of Britain, Picts and Scots, with their separate languages, had been traditional enemies. However, both dynasties were nearly destroyed in a chance three-way battle with Vikings. Then Kenneth MacAlpin of the Dal Riata unified the land by somehow finishing off the Pict royal house. However, continued Viking pressure forced him from the coasts and lowlands. He placed the capital of his new kingdom at Forteviot, in old Pictish territory, and moved his religious center to Dunkeld. There he transferred the remains of St. Columba from Iona.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_territory|You are in territory of Volantis.^^Osraige is one of the largest clans in Ireland. It was the easternmost region within the Kingdom of Mumain until Osraige warlord, Cerball mac Dunlainge, adeptly obtained independence.

qstr_My_name_is_Beda_the_|My name is Beda the Old, and if you delve into this world, I recommend you listen carefully...^^Britain. The Britons call her Ynys Prydein, the Goidels call her Alba while the Angles and Saxons gave the name of Englaland to the lands they conquered. These islands are large, rich and beautiful... and are coveted. So the land is currently at war and respects only the law of the sword and spear. Realms are born and killed off, and kings die on the battlefield. Women are widowed, and horses carry arms instead of hay. The shouts of warriors fill the air, and the earth lies barren from the trampling of armies. As in past eras of strife, mortal enemies rise, equipped in armour. Ravens are calling, wolves are howling, spears clash and shields answer.^^In the north, the kingdoms of the Angles crumble before the advance of the Danes. The sons of the notorious Viking lord Ragnar, the new lords of these lands, now rule Bernaccia, Deira and Elmet, the land known as Northhymbre. ^^In the south, the Saxons of West Seaxe, led by the Brytenwalda Aethelred and his brother Aelfred, prepare for war. They know that on the other side of the sea, more Danes prepare to cross the ocean in search of fame and wealth. ^^Pushed into the remote fringes of their native land by centuries of landward invasion, the native Britons now are threatened by Vikings on their coasts. They fight desperately not to lose what little they have left, dreaming of a king to unify them all and lead them to final victory -- a new King Arthur. The reality is that their equitable inheritance laws keep the holdings of each lord small and unity harder to achieve. Nevertheless, one strongman, Rhodri the Great of Gwynedd, has begun to impose his will over the rest of Wales. ^^In the lands of the far north, Norwegian invaders thirty years ago wiped out the old competing Gaelic and Pict aristocracies in one fatal blow at a chance three-way battle. After this disaster, Gaelic strongman Cinead McAlpin started to forge a new kingdom out of the two peoples, but they have been driven to the highland center of their former territories. ^^Across the sea, in Ireland, Aed 'Fair Warrior' mac Niall of Aileach has emerged as high king in Temair after overcoming his enemies, but it is nothing more than a prestigious title. His claim is never accepted by the other half of the Ui Neill, and the fighting for land, women and cattle, in the sort of fratricidal wars endemic to that land, continues unabated. Meanwhile, both Danish and Norwegian Vikings have established dozens of coastal strongholds. They use the rivers to plunder the Goidelic hinterland, but they are all too prone to join the native conflict -- on all sides. ^^^The world is chaos, and chaos is war.{***}

qstr__VERY_IMPORTANT:_How| VERY IMPORTANT: How does the gamemode Warlords Battle work?^^1. If you are lord, then in the inventory menu you can choose the type of troop command you'd like. If you have more money than usual it's because you need to pay your troops. What does this mean? That all the money you don't spend on buying equipment will be used for wages to battlefield troops (more money = more troops). ^Each basic troop normally costs 50 coins, but if a unit is < level 21, it costs +50 coins. If a unit is < level 25, by each level it cost you +30 coins. And if a unit has horse +50 coins. Keep this in mind when designing your army. Do you prefer quantity over quality? . ^^2. If you are an elite troop no need to worry about recruiting troops, spend all your money equipping the best gear; you have to be a battle champion, someone important, so your performance in battle is essential. ^ Killing, healing allied troops, exploring the territory, taking orders from lords, is all crucial. Also, if the lords fall, the task of leading the troops will fall upon you.^^(press K to finish reading){***}

qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}|As a {reg3?girl:boy} growing out of childhood, you were sent to live in the court of one of the nobles of the land. There, your first lessons were in humility, as you waited upon the lords and ladies of the household. But from their chess games, their gossip, even the poetry of great deeds and courtly love, you quickly began to learn about the adult world of conflict and competition.

When you were named squire to a noble at court, you practised long hours with weapons, learning how to deal out hard knocks and how to take them, too. You were instructed in your obligations to your lord, and of your duties to those who might one day be your vassals. But in addition to learning the chivalric ideal, you also learned about the less uplifting side -- old warriors' stories of ruthless power politics, of betrayals and usurpations, of men who used guile as well as valour to achieve their aims.{***}

qstr_Though_the_distinctio|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. You joined the tightly-knit circle of women at court, ladies who all did proper ladylike things, the wives and mistresses of noble men as well as maidens who had yet to find a husband. However, even here you found politics at work as the ladies schemed for prominence and fought each other bitterly to catch the eye of whatever unmarried man was in fashion at court. You soon learned ways of turning these situations and goings-on to your advantage. With it came the realisation that you yourself could wield great influence in the world, if only you applied yourself with a little bit of subtlety.{***}
qstr_Though_the_distinction|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and the whole world seemed to change around you.

It was a poor existence, with many a hungry night when people failed to appreciate your play, but you managed to survive on your music alone. As the years went by you became adept at playing the drunken crowds in your taverns, and even better at talking anyone out of anything you wanted.{***}
qstr_Though_the_distinction_|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {reg3?woman:man}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. You found yourself as a student in the university of one of the great cities, where you studied theology, philosophy, and medicine. But not all your lessons were learned in the lecture halls. You may or may not have joined in with your fellows as they roamed the alleys in search of wine, women, and a good fight. However, you certainly were able to observe how a broken jaw is set, or how an angry townsman can be persuaded to set down his club and accept cash compensation for the destruction of his shop.{***}
qstr_Though_the_distinction_f|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. Heeding the call of the open road, you travelled from village to village buying and selling what you could.

Soon, you knew, you would be well-placed to start your own trading empire...{***}
qstr_Though_the_distinction_fe|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. You pursued a career as a smith, crafting items of function and beauty out of simple metal. As time wore on you became a master of your trade, and fine work started to fetch fine prices.

qstr_Though_the_distinction_fel|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. Dissatisfied with common men's desperate scrabble for coin, you took to your local lord's own forests and decided to help yourself to its bounty, laws be damned. You hunted stags, boars and geese and sold the precious meat under the table. You cut down trees right under the watchmen's noses and turned them into firewood that warmed many freezing homes during winter. All for a few silvers, of course.{***}
